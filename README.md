# Ashe's Latin Translator v1

## Yee so I'm learning latin!
- Fun shit! This was my first electron project
- Also my first project ever using web scraping with JS
- Also my first project passing states to a hook class 
real-time to update the text in ReactJS
- Took me a week! Very fun and adequately challenging

## How to use??
- Fuck you mac users (jk I love you, but I didn't 
package it for you, sadly)
- Just download the latest from releases assuming
github doesn't murder me for 400mb file
